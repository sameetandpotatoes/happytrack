            This is your week over week interaction count. We really want you to think about if this week was like any other week. If it was, do you think your interaction tracking helped you? If it wasn't, did you hopefully have better interactions this week?

            These are your interactions by day. Try to think back and see if this looks normal or if there are any odd spikes. Do you feel more or less drained any particular day? This could be a sign that the quality of interactions goes down as the number of interactions increases.

            These are your interaction counts over the different areas of your life. We split them up into the reactions that you gave. Do you think you particularly interact a certain way at a given time of day? Maybe you aren't a morning person; then again, no one is.

            These are your interactions over the general period of time divided up by type of interaction. Do you see a trend with your general mood and what is the predominant interaction type in each category? Do you think some categories are just hurting over than helping.

            These are your interactions by people. There are a hundred different ways to try and vizualize this, and we recommend that you can generate your own visualizations at our custom visualizer, but to get give you some inspiration: was this week like any other week? Do you feel you've interacted with someone too much? Not enough?
